                        <p>
                            “How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams.” ― Bram Stoker, Dracula

                        <h2>Five years and counting</h2>
                        <p>
                            Now in its fifth year, the Bram Stoker Festival has evolved from its inaugural incarnation as a literary celebration to a full-brown arts weekender, incorporating theatre, film, music and live performance. The event seeks to celebrate and reclaim Stoker, Dublin's infamous king of the gothic novel and the creator of everyone's favourite vampire, Count Dracula.

                            “Although his name is inextricably tied to Dracula, the festival is interested in the themes and the tinge of Gothic that exists throughout Bram Stoker's work,” says Festival Director Tom Lawlor. “In recent years, the programme has responded to the cannon of work, rather than just Dracula. We want to expand beyond the vampire trope and explore the elements of superstition within Irish heritage and storytelling that exists throughout Stoker's writing.”

                            Stokerland is a free pop-up Victorian fun park over the weekend in St Patrick's Park. Families can catch street theatre, Victorian funfair rides and ghoulish games in the shadow of St Patrick's cathedral. There's also Dracula's Disco on bank holiday Monday at Meeting House Square, and an animation workshop (Sunday) at Brown Bag Films with a director of Disney's Vampirina.

                            The Night of the Shifting Bog is a new circus show from Loosysmokes, an outdoor, night-time aerial acrobatic show in St Anne's Park woodlands in Clontarf; it's based on a passage from The Snake's Pass, Stoker's only novel set in Irish boglands. The Horrors in the Black Church in Dublin Castle's Chapel Royal combines three short horror plays in one show, directed by Anna Shiels McNamee, and written by Peter Dunne, Lauren Shannon Jones and Stuart Roche.

                        <h2>Did You Know…?</h2>
                        <p>Stoker loved to record snippets of overheard conversations in his journal, and detailed a Dublin soaked in sardonic humour, strife, comedy and surreality</p>
                        <p>Stoker's first published book was a guidebook for civil servants, which was the to go-to read for new civil servants until the mid 1950s</p>
                        <p>In 1882, Stoker attempted to rescue a man drowning in the River Thames by leaping into the river… unfortunately, the man was not resuscitated.</p>
                        <p>He founded the Dublin Sketching Club, was a keen athlete and served as President of the Trinity College Historical Society</p>
                        <p>
                            Stoker's wife, Florence Balcombe, outlived her husband by 25 years, previously dated Oscar Wilde, and became embroiled in a legal dispute with the producers of Nosferatu. A fascinating person in her own right, much has been written about her and her life.
                        </p>
                        <p>Stoker was witty and charming, popular in society and and was said to part dancefloors during glittering balls of the age when he took to the dancefloor, such was his skill!</p>
                        <p>You'll find these and even more lesser-known facts in The Lost Journal of Bram Stoker, edited by his great grand nephew, and regular festival participant, Dacre Stoker.</p>
