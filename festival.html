                        <p>
                            Every year, on Haloween, wild and wonderful Macnas charaters with their magical masks cast their spell on all the onlookers on the streets of Dublin!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The festival is overflowing with friendly and aproachable vampires turning up in places and at times they are not usually seen, wandering around the streets and turning up in pubs, restaurants and shops.

                            Now passing into the elventh year, the Bram Stoker Festival has changed times over from its inauguration as a literary celebration to a full-blown arts weekend festival, incorporating theatre, film, music and live performance. An homage for Bram Stoker, Dublin's unrivalled king of the gothic novel and the creator of everyone's favourite vampire, Count Dracula. - Inspired from an <a href="https://www.rte.ie/culture/2016/1026/826978-bram-stoker-festival/" target="_blank">article</a> by <a href="https://www.rte.ie" target="_blank">rte</a>.

                            “Although his name is inextricably tied to Dracula, the festival is interested in the themes and the tinge of Gothic that exists throughout Bram Stoker's work,” says Festival Director Tom Lawlor. “In recent years, the programme has responded to the cannon of work, rather than just Dracula. We want to expand beyond the vampire trope and explore the elements of superstition within Irish heritage and storytelling that exists throughout Stoker's writing.” - Mentioned in an <a href="https://www.rte.ie/culture/2016/1026/826978-bram-stoker-festival/" target="_blank">article</a> by <a href="https://www.rte.ie" target="_blank">rte</a>.
