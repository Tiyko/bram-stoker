                            “How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams.” ― Bram Stoker, Dracula

                            Now in its fifth year, the Bram Stoker Festival has evolved from its inaugural incarnation as a literary celebration to a full-brown arts weekender, incorporating theatre, film, music and live performance. The event seeks to celebrate and reclaim Stoker, Dublin's infamous king of the gothic novel and the creator of everyone's favourite vampire, Count Dracula.

                            “Although his name is inextricably tied to Dracula, the festival is interested in the themes and the tinge of Gothic that exists throughout Bram Stoker's work,” says Festival Director Tom Lawlor. “In recent years, the programme has responded to the cannon of work, rather than just Dracula. We want to expand beyond the vampire trope and explore the elements of superstition within Irish heritage and storytelling that exists throughout Stoker's writing.”

                            The Night of the Shifting Bog is a new circus show from Loosysmokes, an outdoor, night-time aerial acrobatic show in St Anne's Park woodlands in Clontarf; it's based on a passage from The Snake's Pass, Stoker's only novel set in Irish boglands. The Horrors in the Black Church in Dublin Castle's Chapel Royal combines three short horror plays in one show, directed by Anna Shiels McNamee, and written by Peter Dunne, Lauren Shannon Jones and Stuart Roche.

                            Stokerland is a free pop-up Victorian fun park over the weekend in St Patrick's Park. Families can catch street theatre, Victorian funfair rides and ghoulish games in the shadow of St Patrick's cathedral. There's also Dracula's Disco on bank holiday Monday at Meeting House Square, and an animation workshop (Sunday) at Brown Bag Films with a director of Disney's Vampirina.
