## **Website Intro**

Abraham Stoker was in Irish novel writter and a theatre manager, he was the creator of the fantasy novel Dracula as you probably already know or read it on my website (link below). The website aims to educate and offer an introduction into the life of Bram Stoker and his masterpiece creation novel, Dracula. The website also serves as a promotion to Bram Stoker Festival which is celebrated every year in Dublin, Ireland on Halloween. The festival is largely organized by Dublin City Council.
