# **Bram Stoker**

## **Website Intro**

Abraham Stoker was an Irish novel writer and a theatre manager, he was the creator of the fantasy novel Dracula as you probably already know or read it on my website (link below). The website aims to educate and offer an introduction into the life of Bram Stoker and his masterpiece creation novel, Dracula. The website also serves as a promotion to Bram Stoker Festival which is celebrated every year in Dublin, Ireland on Halloween. The festival is largely organized by Dublin City Council.

**The website is live on Github Pages [Linked Here](https://tiyko.github.io/bram-stoker/index.html)**

  * I planned, to overcomplicate things and learn how to simplify and/or debug them.
  * I planned, to introduce a greater amount of content.
  * I planned, to make a greater amount of content accessible.
  * I planned, a side navigation bar for larger tablets and desktop size screens.
  * I planned, to have the navigation bar appear on top for small devices (mobile phones, smaller tablets).
  * I planned, wireframes
  * I planned, the Landing page to have an introductive summary with links for people who want a deeper understanding.
  * I planned, the Career page to express general life works and most notable works.

### **Wireframes**

To follow a pattern and make my life easier before I engaged in creating the website, first I drew wireframes using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).

* Desktop wireframes:
  * [Desktop diagram top part](docs/wireframes/initial-desktop-top.png)
  * [Desktop diagram bottom part](docs/wireframes/desktop-bottom-part.png)

* Mobile phones and small tablets:
  * [Small devices diagram](docs/wireframes/initial-phones.png)

After I learned more practical use of HTML/CSS, I decided to make some modifications to the initial wireframes to offer a clearer view into the background image by moving down and off the screen the initial content containers and replace them with a call to action indicator in the bottom part of the screen.

I also learned how to make the aside container display alone on the screen on the initial page load to include it better in the theme along with the background-image.

* New and final wireframe versions:

  * [Small devices diagram](docs/wireframes/phones.png)

### **Common Features**

***

#### ***Navigation bar***

* The navigation bar appears on all 6 pages (including dracula_story.html and contact_feedback.html).
* Contains links to Biography, Career, Festival, and About page to facilitate navigation within the website.
* It is fixed to the left side on desktops and larger tablet devices and at the top on mobile phones and smaller tablets, and this way eliminates the need for a "scroll back to top button".
* Each of the four buttons has an animation on hover, fade in and fade out.
* Once a button is pressed will fill in the animation to mark the current page the user is exploring.
* Navigation bar has dark a red image to fit into the vampire theme.

#### ***Call to action***

* On all pages there is a call to action indicator designed to get the attention of the user to take action in scrolling down.
* The indicator is comprised of two symbols (up and down) at the top and bottom with the message "Scroll to read more" between the symbols.
* It has an infinite animation scaling in and out 20%.

* Its purpose is to compliment every page's theme.

### **Biography / Landing Page**

***

* This is the index page, also called the landing page or the home page.
* Here the user becomes comfortable about the general meaning of the website.
* The large striking background image of a vampire nearby Bran Castle is stating that the website might be about Dracula.
* The side section on the right is meant to complement the background image and assure the user that the website is about Bram Stoker by presenting a short introduction about his life and most notable work, Dracula.

* The large eye-catchy background is meant to also catch the user's attention and make them comfortable to stay and explore the website even if they might not be fans.
* As soon as the user answers the call to action, at the bottom of the screen the user is presented with a concise introduction about Bram Stoker, along with pictures to keep the user entertained.
