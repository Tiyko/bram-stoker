# **Bram Stoker**

## **Website Intro**

Abraham Stoker was an Irish novel writer and a theatre manager, he was the creator of the fantasy novel Dracula as you probably already know or read it on my website (link below). The website aims to educate and offer an introduction into the life of Bram Stoker and his masterpiece creation novel, Dracula. The website also serves as a promotion to Bram Stoker Festival which is celebrated every year in Dublin, Ireland on Halloween. The festival is largely organized by Dublin City Council.

**The website is live on Github Pages [Linked Here](https://tiyko.github.io/bram-stoker/index.html)**

  * I planned, to introduce a greater amount of content.
  * I planned, to make a greater amount of content accessible.
  * I planned, a side navigation bar for larger tablets and desktop size screens.
  * I planned, to have the navigation bar appear on top for small devices (mobile phones, smaller tablets).
  * I planned, wireframes
  * I planned, the Landing page to have an introductive summary with links for people who want a deeper understanding.
  * I planned, the Career page to express general life works and most notable works.

## **UI Design**

### **Wireframes**

To follow a pattern and make my life easier before I engaged in creating the website, first I drew wireframes using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).

* Desktop wireframes:
  * [Desktop diagram top part](docs/wireframes/initial-desktop-top.png)
  * [Desktop diagram bottom part](docs/wireframes/desktop-bottom-part.png)

* Mobile phones and small tablets:
  * [Small devices diagram](docs/wireframes/initial-phones.png)

After I learned more practical use of HTML/CSS, I decided to make some modifications to the initial wireframes to offer a clearer view into the background image by moving down and off the screen the initial content containers and replace them with a call to action indicator in the bottom part of the screen.

I also learned how to make the aside container display alone on the screen on the initial page load to include it better in the theme along with the background-image.

* New and final wireframe versions:
  * [Desktop diagram top part](docs/wireframes/desktop-top-part.png)
  * [Small devices diagram](docs/wireframes/phones.png)

### **Common Features**

***

#### ***Navigation bar***

* The navigation bar appears on all 6 pages (including dracula_story.html and contact_feedback.html).
* Contains links to Biography, Career, Festival, and About page to facilitate navigation within the website.
* It is fixed to the left side on desktops and larger tablet devices and at the top on mobile phones and smaller tablets, and this way eliminates the need for a "scroll back to top button".
* Each of the four buttons has an animation on hover, fade in and fade out.
* Once a button is pressed will fill in the animation to mark the current page the user is exploring.
* Navigation bar has dark a red image to fit into the vampire theme.

* On all pages there is a call to action indicator designed to get the attention of the user to take action in scrolling down.
* The indicator is comprised of two symbols (up and down) at the top and bottom with the message "Scroll to read more" between the symbols.
* It has an infinite animation scaling in and out 20%.

### **Biography / Landing Page**

***

* This is the index page, also called the landing page or the home page.
* The page has useful links marked in orange leading to Wikipedia, in case the user wants a more in-depth read.
* Here the user becomes comfortable about the general meaning of the website.
* The large striking background image of a vampire nearby Bran Castle is stating that the website might be about Dracula.
* The side section on the right is meant to complement the background image and assure the user that the website is about Bram Stoker by presenting a short introduction about his life and most notable work, Dracula.

* The large eye-catchy background is meant to also catch the user's attention and make them comfortable to stay and explore the website even if they might not be fans.

***

* The career page is a summary of Bram Stoker's early career to later in life when he became famous for the immense success of Dracula.
* Theatre was Bram Stoker's life and to emphasize this, the background image tries to make the user immediately understand that is referred to the Theatre.
* The section on the right with the title "Theatre life" complements and seals that this page is referred to a career in Theatre before the user has read any content.

#### ***Dracula's story page***

* At the bottom of the career page, a short introductory section can be found with a link leading to a summary of the book in case the user does not want to read the book, but a summary would suffice.

* This page is complementary to the career page and has a summary of the book in just 9 total sections.
* In addition to Wikipedia links, here the section on right side, there is a section that leads to Wikisource for a full read of Dracula book, in case the user wishes to do so.

### **About page**

***

* This page offers a means to contact festival organizers via the form on the right-side section.
* The form is made to be simple and intuitive, with a section for username, user contact information, a text area option for feedback, and an option to subscribe to a newsletter system and receive the latest news about future events from the Dublin City Council Events Unit.
* A big stylish button to the bottom of the form inverting colors on hovering, so the user can submit the form after is done.
* Right under the form, a small section presents details in case the user wants to use their own email service to contact the events unit.
* The background represents pretty much my present skills in animation in CSS.
* The skewed element's animation is to start expanding from the top-right corner in diagonal.
* To stick to the theme I have chosen a pinkish gradient color and on top a skewed element with a red gradient background.
![About Page](docs/screenshots/about_page.webp)
* Answering the call to action can read about the website, website author, and its purpose.
* There is a section for credits and research as this website does not have any real affiliation with Dublin City Council and is created for education and learning purposes only.
