                                Stoker published his stories since 1872, including the "Crystal Cup" (1872), his first horror tale "The Chain of Destiny" (1875), a collection of children's stories Under the Sunset (1881), and his first novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snake%27s_Pass" target="_blank">The Snake's Pass (1890)</a>, but he did not realize fame until the overwhelming success of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula" target="_blank">Dracula (1897)</a>. The reasons for Dracula's success are many, and it has become a major focus for stage, musical and cinematic adaptations and, more recently, has become a major focus of academic criticism.

                                Stoker was a regular visitor to Cruden Bay in Scotland between 1893 and 1910. His month-long holidays to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeenshire" target="_blank">Aberdeenshire</a> coastal village provided a large portion of available time for writing his books. Two novels were set in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruden_Bay" target="_blank">Cruden Bay</a>: The Watter's Mou' (1895) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystery_of_the_Sea" target="_blank">The Mystery of the Sea (1902)</a>. He started writing Dracula there in 1895 while in residence at the Kilmarnock Arms Hotel. The guest book with his signatures from 1894 and 1895 still survives. The nearby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Slains_Castle" target="_blank">Slains Castle</a> (also known as New Slains Castle) is linked with Bram Stoker and plausibly provided the visual palette for the descriptions of Castle Dracula during the writing phase. A distinctive room in Slains Castle, the octagonal hall, matches the description of the octagonal room in Castle Dracula.

                                In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gala%C8%9Bi" target="_blank">Galati</a>, Romania, the hunters split up. Van Helsing and Mina go to Dracula's castle, where the professor destroys the vampire women. Jonathan Harker and Arthur Holmwood follow Dracula's boat on the river, while Quincey Morris and John Seward parallel them on land. After Dracula's box is finally loaded onto a wagon by Szgany men, the hunters converge and attack it.

                                After routing the Szgany, Harker slashes Dracula's neck and Quincey stabs him in the heart. Dracula crumbles to dust, freeing Mina from her vampiric curse. Quincey is mortally wounded in the fight against the Szgany. He dies from his wounds, at peace with the knowledge that Mina is saved. A note by Jonathan Harker seven years later states that the Harkers have a son, named Quincey.

                            The collaboration with Henry Irving was important for Stoker and through him he became involved in London's high society, where he met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Abbott_McNeill_Whistler" target="_blank">James Abbott McNeill Whistler</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle" target="_blank">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a> (to whom he was distantly related). Working for Irving, the most famous actor of his time, and managing one of the most successful theatres in London made Stoker a notable if busy man. He was dedicated to Irving and his memoirs show he idolised him. In London, Stoker also met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_Caine" target="_blank">Hall Caine</a>, who became one of his closest friends and he dedicated Dracula to him.

                            In 1878, Stoker married <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Balcombe" target="_blank">Florence Balcombe</a>, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel James Balcombe of 1 Marino Crescent. She was a celebrated beauty whose former suitor had been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde" target="_blank">Oscar Wilde</a>. Stoker had known Wilde from his student days, having proposed him for membership of the university's Philosophical Society while he was president. Wilde was upset at Florence's decision, but Stoker later resumed the acquaintanceship, and, after Wilde's fall, visited him on the Continent.
