                        <p>
                            My name is Ionut (Romanian for Johnny), and this website's purpose is to educate and give an introduction to, the man who gave us Dracula, Bram Stoker. It brings together his life as novelist writter, career in theatre and the commemoration that we have today in Dublin, Ireland on Halloween know as Bram Stoker Festival.

                            To put this website together I have made an extensive research on public domain's available data about Bram stoker such as wikipedia, wikisource and victorianweb for information about his life. I have used news websites like irishtimes and rte.ie to quote and insipre from key paragraphs important to highlight Bram Stoker Festival.

                            The pictures i have used on the website are all picked from public domain websites or users of flickr who have chosed to have their work out on public domain and I am grateful that they did so as it allowed me to give the website a more plasent and interactive look and feel. The websites used are wikimedia, openverse (as a search engine), flickr and publicdomain.net for the largest part. All pictures are connected to their original location with clickable links to give credit to their authors and also a full view of the pictures.
